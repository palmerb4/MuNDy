As Mundy grows, we need a higher level of abstraction and organization to better support our end goals. Toward this end, 
we are restructuring Mundy into the following namespaces, classes, and methods. This is a work in progress and will be
updated as we go. Where applicable, we show the parent class that our methods inherit from.

mundy
  throw_assert

mundy::balance
  (Various load balancing settings and maybe an stk::balance wrapper if we need it. I would like to use kway_part_geom 
   but it is not currently supported.)

mundy::search

This change breaks mundy::methods into more manageable pieces and introduces a more granular view of Mundy.
