/// @brief A helper macro for registering a \c Multibody with \c MultibodyFactory.
///
/// This macro is used to register a \c Multibody with \c MultibodyFactory. The macro should be
/// used in the following way:
///
/// \code{.cpp}
/// MUNDY_REGISTER_MULTIBODYTYPE(ClassToRegister)
/// \endcode
///
/// There are some important notes about proper use of this macro:
///
/// - Registration in Global Scope: The registration should typically be done in the global scope, not inside any
/// function (including main()). This is because if the registration is done inside a function, it will not happen until
/// that function is called, which could be after main() starts.
///
/// - Registration in Source Files: Best practice is to perform registration in a source file, not a header file. This
/// is because if the registration is done in a header file, it will be registered in every translation unit that
/// includes that header file. This can lead to multiple registrations of the same class, which will cause an error.
/// Using header guards will not prevent this issue.
///
/// - No Dependency on Other Static Variables in Registration: Since C++ doesn't guarantee an order of initialization
/// for static variables across different translation units, you should make sure that the registration of a multibody
/// type does not depend on the initialization of other static variables. If it does, those variables might not be
/// initialized at the time the multibody type is registered.
///
/// - No Duplicated Names: Each multibody type must be registered (to a certain MetaFactory) with a unique
/// identifier. If two classes are registered with the same identifier, only the first one will actually be registered,
/// and subsequent registrations will throw an error. While allowing overwriting of existing registrations is possible,
/// we chose to not implement such functionality because it could lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, when using
/// static initialization across multiple translation units, there is no guaranteed order of initialization. This means
/// that if two classes are registered with the same identifier, it is not guaranteed which one will be registered
/// first.
///
/// As long as these points are followed, the registration of multibody type subclasses should occur before main()
/// starts.
///
/// \note To anyone reading this code, it may seem like the is_registered variable is unused. However, this is not the
/// case. When the program is started, one of the first steps is to initialize static objects. Even if is_registered
/// appears to be unused, static storage duration guarantees that this variable wonâ€™t be optimized away.
///
