/// \brief All of our headers for aggregates of primitive geometric objects
///
/// These aggregates follow the data oriented design pattern with view objects that provide object-like access to
/// object data stored within bucketed structure of arrays while maintaining some independence from how the data is
/// stored. This is best explained by example.
///
/// Consider a collection of sphere-like objects stored as PARTICLE topology stk::mesh::Entity objects with element-rank
/// radius and node-rank center coordinates. We store the stk::mesh::NgpField for the radius and center coordinates
/// within the SphereData aggregate. This struct has no methods, only data members, and is meant to organize the data for
/// the spheres to simplify interfaces and to allow for functional dispatch based on the data type. Our current
/// SphereData struct allows users to either provide a field for the radius and center or to provide a single value for
/// each, meant to be shared by all spheres. Use create_sphere_data to aid in creating the SphereData struct.
///
/// If you wish to augment the SphereData struct with additional data, you can create a new struct that meets the
/// ValidDefaultSphereDataType concept; aka, it has the same data members as SphereData. Alternatively, if you don't want
/// to name your center and radius data members the same as SphereData or if you want to use a different access pattern,
/// you can create a new struct and provide a specialization of SphereDataTraits for your new struct. Doing so allows you
/// to seamlessly use our SphereEntityView view object with your new struct. Note, we suggest that augmentations only add
/// data members and not methods to maintain the data oriented design pattern. Aggregates hold data and non-member
/// functions operate on that data, making for more extensible and maintainable code.
///
/// The SphereEntityView struct is a view object that provides object-like access to the sphere data stored in the mesh.
/// It is constructed to give an identical interface to the Sphere primitive object, but it is constructed from the
/// entity and the mesh. Most importantly, it will not access the field data until the user requests it. This way, if you
/// don't use the node coordinates of the sphere, we won't fetch them from the mesh. This is important for performance
/// when using complex aggregates with many fields and is a key benefit of the data oriented design pattern. While our
/// view pattern requires repeated object construction, we have optimized our objects to have minimal overhead with less
/// than a 0.1% overhead compared to direct field access.
///
/// The above is general to all of our primitive types. All you need to do is replace Sphere with the primitive type you
/// are interested in. They all implement the same pattern.
