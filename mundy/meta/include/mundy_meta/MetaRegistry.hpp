/// \code{.cpp}
/// MUNDY_IS_REGISTERED(ClassToCheck, FactoryToCheckWith)

/// \note The second argument to this macro is supposed to be the \c MetaMethodFactory that the class should be

/// FactoryToCheckWith to potentially be a templated class with multiple template arguments. In this case, the C++
/// macro system will interpret the comma in the template arguments as a macro argument separator, which is not what we
/// want. As a result, we need to use the "..." syntax to collect those additional arguments and merge them
/// together into the desired \c FactoryToCheckWith using \c __VA_ARGS__.
///
/// \note This macro used a lambda function to check if the class has been registered. This ensures that each use of
/// \c MUNDY_IS_REGISTERED does not create a new definition of \c is_registered, thereby avoiding multiple definition
/// errors.

/// @brief A helper macro for registering a \c MetaMethodSubsetExecutionInterface with the \c MetaMethodFactory.
///
/// This macro is used to register a \c MetaMethodSubsetExecutionInterface with the \c MetaMethodFactory. The macro
/// should be used in the following way:
///
/// \code{.cpp}
/// MUNDY_REGISTER_METACLASS(Key, ClassToRegister, FactoryToRegisterWith)
/// \endcode
///
/// There are some important notes about proper use of this macro:
///
/// - Registration in Global Scope: The registration should typically be done in the global scope, not inside any
/// function (including main()). This is because if the registration is done inside a function, it will not happen until
/// that function is called, which could be after main() starts.
///
/// - Registration in Source Files: Best practice is to perform registration in a source file, not a header file. This
/// is because if the registration is done in a header file, it will be registered in every translation unit that
/// includes that header file. This can lead to multiple registrations of the same class, which will cause an error.
/// Using header guards will not prevent this issue.
///
/// - No Dependency on Other Static Variables in Registration: Since C++ doesn't guarantee an order of initialization
/// for static variables across different translation units, you should make sure that the registration of a MetaClass
/// does not depend on the initialization of other static variables. If it does, those variables might not be
/// initialized at the time the MetaClass is registered.
///
/// - No Duplicated Names: Each MetaClass must be registered (to a certain MetaFactory) with a unique
/// identifier. If two classes are registered with the same identifier, only the first one will actually be registered,
/// and subsequent registrations will throw an error. While allowing overwriting of existing registrations is possible,
/// we chose to not implement such functionality because it could lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, when using
/// static initialization across multiple translation units, there is no guaranteed order of initialization. This means
/// that if two classes are registered with the same identifier, it is not guaranteed which one will be registered
/// first.
///
/// - No commas within the key: The key should not contain any commas, as this will cause the macro to interpret the
/// key as multiple arguments. I see absolutely no reason why a key would need to contain a comma, so this should not be
/// an issue.
///
/// \note The third argument to this macro is supposed to be the \c MetaMethodFactory that the class should be
/// registered with. The reason we use the weird "... /* FactoryToRegisterWith */" syntax is because we want to allow
/// FactoryToRegisterWith to potentially be a templated class with multiple template arguments. In this case, the C++
/// macro system will interpret the comma in the template arguments as a macro argument separator, which is not what we
/// want. As a result, we need to use the "..." syntax to collect those additional arguments and merge them
/// together into the desired \c FactoryToRegisterWith using \c __VA_ARGS__.
///
/// \param Key The key to register the class with. This key should be unique within the \c MetaMethodFactory.
/// \param ClassToRegister A class derived from \c MetaMethodSubsetExecutionInterface that we wish to register.
/// \param FactoryToRegisterWith The \c MetaMethodFactory to register the class with.
