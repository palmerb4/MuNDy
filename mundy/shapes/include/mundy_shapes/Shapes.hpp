/// \class Shapes
/// In the current design, a "shape" is an element-rank Part with some set of requirements that endow the entities of
/// that part with some shape. For example,
///   - a point particle can be represented as having a PARTICLE topology with one node at its center (it need not be
///   orientable)
///   - a line particle can be represented as having a LINE_3 topology with three nodes (one at each end and one at its
///   center).
///   - a sphere is a point particle with an element radius.
///   - an ellipsoid is a point particle with three element axis lengths and an element orientation.
///   - a spherocylinder is a point particle with an element radius, length, and orientation.
///   - a spherocylidner_segment is a line segment with element radius and length.
///   - a NURBS is a SUPERTOPOLOGY<N> with N nodes corresponding to the control points.
///
/// The design of this class is in accordance with the static interface requirements of mundy::agents::AgentFactory.
///
/// \note This class is an element rank assembly part containing all shapes. It is a subset of the Agents part.
