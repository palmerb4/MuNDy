/// \brief Map a string with a valid set of selector math to the corresponding selector.
///
/// Selectors are allowed to be combined using the following operators:
///  - Subtraction:    -
///  - Arythmetic and: &
///  - Arythmetic or:  |
///  - Unary not:      !
///  - Parentheses:   ( )
///
/// For example, to select all elements of parts A and B that are not in part C, the selector string would be:
///   "(partA | partB) & !partC"
/// To instead, get all elements in both parts A and B that are not in part C, the selector string would be:
///   "(partA & partB) & !partC"
///
/// Spaces are allowed in the selector string, but are not required. Names may contain any combination of letters,
/// numbers, underscores, and periods, so long as they start with a letter.
///
/// The names of the parts are fetched from the BulkData object. If a part name is not found, an exception is thrown.
/// We offer the following special part names:
///  - "UNIVERSAL"        -> The universal part, which contains all entities.
///  - "LOCALLY_OWNED"    -> The locally owned part, which contains all entities owned by the current process.
///  - "GLOBALLY_SHARED"  -> The globally shared part, which contains all entities shared from another processes.
///  - "AURA"             -> The automatically generated auto part, which contains all entities ghosted from another process.
///
/// \param bulk_data [in] BulkData object used to fetch the part names.
/// \param selector_string [in] String containing valid selector math.
