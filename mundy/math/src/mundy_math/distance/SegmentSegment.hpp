/* Notes:

The purpose of the segment-segment distance function is to compute the distance between two line segments in 3D space.
How one performs this calculation varies widely from software to software and is not always well-documented. One of the
core difficulties in this calculation is addressing edge cases (parallel rods, perpendicular rods, degenerate rods,
etc). Importantly, some implementations do not account for all edge cases and lack of documentation makes it hard to
tell a-priori if a given implementation is correct or covers all possibilities.

We looked at existing implementations in VTK, NVIDIA Flex/PhysX, HOOMD-blue, and DCPquery from Geometric Tools. They all
have benefits and drawbacks. By far, VTK was the best documented and most thoroughly tested. Their code is located here
  VTK/Common/DataModel/vtkLine.cxx
and their tests here
  VTK/Common/DataModel/Testing/Cxx/UnitTestLine.cxx

However, they do perform some questionable operations, such as exact comparisons to 0.0 and 1.0 and using 1e-6 as their
zero tolerance.

To start, we'll copy VTK's algorithm, replace their use of Scalar[3] arrays with our Vector3, and attempt to replicate
their validation tests. We may also make minor modifications to the algorithm to improve performance, readability, and
accuracy.

A note about our Vector3s: mundy::math::Vector3 is templated by T and AccessorType. This allows Vector3 with non-owning
memory access. Usually, users will interact with Vector3<Scalar>, which defaults to owning a Scalar[3], but for function
calls that can accept Vector3's with non-owning memory, you should write Vector3<T> instead.
