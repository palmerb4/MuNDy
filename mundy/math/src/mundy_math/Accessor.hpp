// Separation of Concerns: Vectors, Matrices, and Quaternions shouldn't care about memory access patterns.
// They should be able to work with any type of memory access pattern, whether it is contiguous or strided, owned or
// unowned. This is especially important for GPU-compatable code.
//
// To achieve this, Vectors, Matrices, and Quaternions will be templated by an Accessor class. In each case, an Accessor
// needs to be copyable and provide a const [] operator. If the Accessor is able to be modified, it should also provide
// a non-const [] operator. The signatures of these operators are as follows:
//   KOKKOS_INLINE_FUNCTION const T& operator[](size_t idx) const;
//   KOKKOS_INLINE_FUNCTION T& operator[](size_t idx); // Optional
// For Vector3, idx is 0, 1, or 2.
// For Matrix3, it is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.
// For Quaternion, it is 0, 1, 2, or 3.
// The underlying type of the accessor can be fetched with std::remove_reference_t<decltype(accessor[0])>. Or,
// alternatively, Vector3, Matrix3, and Quaternion can be templated by T and AccessorType. This approach allows us to
// define default Accessors while still allowing templating by T.
//
// Accessors may be owning or non-owning, that is irrelevant to the Vector3, Matrix3, and Quaternion classes; however,
// these accessors should be lightweight such that they can be copied around without much overhead. As a result, the
// lifetime of the data underlying the accessor should be as long as the Vector3, Matrix3, or Quaternion that use it.
//
// For efficiency reasons, accessors may consider using a stride between elements. Again, this is irrelevant to the
// Vector3, Matrix3, and Quaternion classes.
//
// Good examples of accessors include the following:
//   - A simple pointer to the data (non-owning)
//   - A Kokkos::View (non-owning)
//   - A class that wraps a pointer and a stride (non-owning)
//   - A class that owns a T array with or without a stride (owning)
//
// Bad examples of accessors include the following:
//   - A std::vector (owning) due to its HEAVY copy constructor
//   - A std::shared_ptr (owning) due to its lack of thread safety
//
// By default, a Vector3, Matrix3, or Quaternion will use a non-strided owning accessor consisting of a T[3], T[9], or
// T[4] and the necessary const and non-const [] operators.
//
// To give our accessors names, we will use the following naming convention:
//   - Vector3Data, Matrix3Data, or QuaternionData: contain non-strided arrays of the correct sizes templated by type
//   - Vector3View, Matrix3View, or QuaternionView: contain Kokkos::Views templated by type and layout
// Note that there are no inherent requirements on the types within the accessors, simply requirements on lengths. It's
// up to Vector3, Matrix3, and Quaternion to enforce their type requirements. As a result, the Data and View classes can
// all be consistently named as Arrays and Views, respectively and templated by their size.
